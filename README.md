# Riot-Access-Control

Riot Access Control is a C++ executable binary that denies user access to "video games" such as league of legends, valorant, and any other Riot-based application content. This project is closed source due to information security purposes. 

Requirements:

1. Microsoft Visual C++ 2008, 2013, 2015-2022 Redistributles for both x86 and x64
2. Latest .NET framework installed on any Windows 10 machine

Note:

If you are still able to access riot-based "video games" after execution, you may need to install the latest version of visual studios community. This ensures all necessary SDKs and AddOns are installed.
